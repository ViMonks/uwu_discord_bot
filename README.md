# uwu_discord_bot
Deletes a target player's messages in discord and replays them translated into uwu.

You'll need to get the target's Discord ID, which you can do by enabling developer mode in the Discord client and right clicking their name.

You'll need to create a .env file in the same directory with your Discord API key. If you need help on how to set that up, or to get the rest of the Discord side of things working, see this tutorial: https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/#how-to-make-a-discord-bot-in-the-developer-portal
